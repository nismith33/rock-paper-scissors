# rock-paper-scissors
Play rock-paper-scissors in browser.

This browser game lets a user play rock-paper-scissors against a computer
opponent (first to 5). The user may also restart the game at any time by
clicking the 'Restart' button. The computer currently selects options randomly, 
but I might come back and add several computer opponents with different 
selection strategies (in particular, I might want to implement the 'Iocaine
Powder' strategy).
